# pkg/bild

this directory contains code adapted from [anthonynsimon/bild](https://github.com/anthonynsimon/bild),
which is licensed under the mit license.

we use parts of the original codebase and, in some cases,
modify or simplify it to better fit our needs.
any changes from the upstream project are made with clarity
and maintainability in mind.

selective changes have been made (naming, structure, and behavior)
to align with our project requirements.
